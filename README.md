# ovo-2-modding-testing

if anyone sees this lol then this is my attempt at figuring out how ovo 2 modding works. im currently trying to figure out how to Tick because my behaviors mod wont work correctly without it. if you feel like you can help, my best attempt is "tick testing.js" so feel free to try on your own and submit a pull request
