# ovo-2-modding-testing

if anyone sees this lol then this is my attempt at figuring out how ovo 2 modding works. If whoever sees this wants to help, just do some stuff on your own and let me know on Discord. If you need to use Ticking, look at [ticking.js](https://github.com/OvOPlant/ovo-2-modding-testing/blob/main/ticking.js). I'm currently trying to port over a few OvO mods to OvO 2. What I have done so far: Half of my behaviors mod, and the whole savestate mod.
